# Nine-Five-Scheduler
Work Day Scheduler

Decscription: 
For this project I built a Work Day Scheduler. A user will enter events at specific times thoughout the work day and save them. The application will then color code each event depending on the time block and indicate whether the event is scheduled for the past (grey), present (green),or future (red).
Some technoligies that I used in this project were momentjs to create a current date and time that will synch with each day and timezone. I used bootstrap to create the grid for each timeblock.

I had a bit of difficulty getting the date and time to display. It was also a bit difficult trying to figure out the momentjs commands. I did like this project a lot. I liked searching through all the styles on bootstrap and I can see how that tool can really come in handy.
